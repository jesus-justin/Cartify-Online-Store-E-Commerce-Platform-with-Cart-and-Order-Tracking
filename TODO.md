# TODO: Enhance Cartify E-Commerce Platform with Advanced Visuals and Animations

## Overview
Elevate the site's visuals to match or surpass Lazada and Shopee with professional animations, ensuring no impact on existing functionality.

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Enhance JS/effects.js
- [ ] Add scroll-triggered animations (parallax for hero, reveal on scroll for sections).
- [ ] Implement loading spinners for dynamic content.
- [ ] Add animated counters for prices and quantities.
- [ ] Introduce smooth page transitions and micro-interactions (e.g., button presses with feedback).
- [ ] Ensure animations are performant and responsive.

### 2. Update CSS/index.css
- [ ] Enhance hero animations with parallax and advanced keyframes (e.g., floating elements).
- [ ] Improve button hovers with glows, scales, and pulse effects.
- [ ] Add skeleton loading animations for content.
- [ ] Introduce bounce and rotate effects for interactive elements.

### 3. Update CSS/header.css
- [ ] Add advanced navigation animations (e.g., slide-in menu, active link glow).
- [ ] Implement header parallax on scroll.
- [ ] Enhance hover effects with color transitions and shadows.

### 4. Update CSS/products.css
- [ ] Add product card flip animations on hover.
- [ ] Implement staggered load animations for product grid.
- [ ] Enhance button interactions with advanced hovers and ripples.
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for product images.

### 5. Update CSS/cart.css
- [ ] Add slide-in animations for cart items.
- [ ] Implement table row hover effects with scales and color changes.
- [ ] Enhance buttons with glows and transitions.
- [ ] Add empty cart animation (e.g., fade-in message).

### 6. Update CSS/checkout.css
- [ ] Add progress bar animation for checkout steps.
- [ ] Implement form field focus animations with scales and shadows.
- [ ] Enhance submit button with loading state animation.
- [ ] Add success message fade-in with icons.

### 7. Update CSS/order_history.css
- [ ] Add table row animations with delays for staggered effect.
- [ ] Implement hover effects with scales and highlights.
- [ ] Enhance buttons with advanced transitions.
- [ ] Add no-orders message animation.

### 8. Testing and Verification
- [ ] Run the site locally via XAMPP and test animations on all pages.
- [ ] Check responsiveness on mobile and desktop.
- [ ] Ensure no functionality is broken (e.g., links, forms still work).
- [ ] Verify performance (no lag on animations).

## Notes
- All changes are visual-only; no PHP or DB logic altered.
- Use unified color palette: blues (#1e90ff), oranges (#ff4500), gradients.
- Animations should be smooth, professional, and inspired by Lazada/Shopee (e.g., micro-interactions, loading states).
