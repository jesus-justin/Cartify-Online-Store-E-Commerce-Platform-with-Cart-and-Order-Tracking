# TODO: Enhance Cartify E-Commerce Platform with Advanced Visuals and Animations

## Overview
Elevate the site's visuals to match or surpass Lazada and Shopee with professional animations, ensuring no impact on existing functionality.

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Enhance JS/effects.js
- [x] Add scroll-triggered animations (parallax for hero, reveal on scroll for sections).
- [x] Implement loading spinners for dynamic content.
- [x] Add animated counters for prices and quantities.
- [x] Introduce smooth page transitions and micro-interactions (e.g., button presses with feedback).
- [x] Ensure animations are performant and responsive.

### 2. Update CSS/index.css
- [x] Enhance hero animations with parallax and advanced keyframes (e.g., floating elements).
- [x] Improve button hovers with glows, scales, and pulse effects.
- [x] Add skeleton loading animations for content.
- [x] Introduce bounce and rotate effects for interactive elements.

### 3. Update CSS/header.css
- [x] Add advanced navigation animations (e.g., slide-in menu, active link glow).
- [x] Implement header parallax on scroll.
- [x] Enhance hover effects with color transitions and shadows.

### 4. Update CSS/products.css
- [x] Add product card flip animations on hover.
- [x] Implement staggered load animations for product grid.
- [x] Enhance button interactions with advanced hovers and ripples.
- [x] Add loading skeletons for product images.

### 5. Update CSS/cart.css
- [x] Add slide-in animations for cart items.
- [x] Implement table row hover effects with scales and color changes.
- [x] Enhance buttons with glows and transitions.
- [x] Add empty cart animation (e.g., fade-in message).

### 6. Update CSS/checkout.css
- [x] Add progress bar animation for checkout steps.
- [x] Implement form field focus animations with scales and shadows.
- [x] Enhance submit button with loading state animation.
- [x] Add success message fade-in with icons.

### 7. Update CSS/order_history.css
- [x] Add table row animations with delays for staggered effect.
- [x] Implement hover effects with scales and highlights.
- [x] Enhance buttons with advanced transitions.
- [x] Add no-orders message animation.

### 8. Testing and Verification
- [x] Run the site locally via XAMPP and test animations on all pages.
- [x] Check responsiveness on mobile and desktop.
- [x] Ensure no functionality is broken (e.g., links, forms still work).
- [x] Verify performance (no lag on animations).

## Revision Notes
- Simplified animations to remove over-the-top effects like excessive scaling, complex keyframes, and performance-heavy features.
- Kept essential interactions: hover effects, scroll reveals, button clicks, and staggered loads.
- Maintained professional look while ensuring smooth performance and alignment with modern e-commerce standards.

## Notes
- All changes are visual-only; no PHP or DB logic altered.
- Use unified color palette: blues (#1e90ff), oranges (#ff4500), gradients.
- Animations should be smooth, professional, and inspired by Lazada/Shopee (e.g., micro-interactions, loading states).
